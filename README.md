# Random-Username-Generator
NAME : BAYYANI HANUSH
DOMAIN : PYTHON PROGRAMMING
DURATION : 1 MONTH

# DESCRIPTION

This Python project creates a program that generates random usernames.  It utilizes the random and string modules to select characters from predefined sets, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and optionally, symbols. The user can specify the desired length of the username. The program then combines these randomly chosen characters to form a string, which represents the generated username.  The project demonstrates core Python concepts like string manipulation, loops, and random number generation.  It can be extended to include features like ensuring uniqueness or more complex character combinations.  The resulting usernames can be used for various purposes, such as creating temporary accounts or generating placeholder data.  The project serves as a practical exercise in applying fundamental programming principles.  It offers a foundation for understanding how to work with strings and randomness in Python.  The code is designed to be readable and easily modifiable.
